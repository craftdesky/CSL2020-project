# Project Contributions

## Jaenil

* Led the main frontend and backend development of the project.
* Built the core **Graph class**, forming the base code for route management and algorithms.
* Worked across full‑stack areas to ensure smooth integration and functionality.
* Designed the overall **backend architecture**, including:

  * Core services controlling graph logic
  * API‑like handler functions for operations such as adding airports, updating routes, path queries, etc.

## Nihar

* Focused primarily on backend development.
* Implemented key algorithms including:

  * **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: optimized for shortest‑distance and lowest‑cost routing, integrated with priority queue logic.
  * **Fewest Stops Algorithm**: created a BFS‑based routing method minimizing the number of intermediate airports.
  * **Bellman–Ford Algorithm**: designed for extended route calculations and graphs where cost/distance could theoretically involve negative weights.
* Ensured efficient routing logic and correctness in pathfinding.

## Krish

* Played a major role in creating the project video, handling visuals, editing, and presentation quality.
* Contributed to the **Analysis Page**, including:

  * Designing metric‑based layout blocks (degree distribution, traversal metrics, subnetwork visuals, etc.)
  * UI development
  * Integrating logic to fetch and display graph insights visually
  * Page structure
* Added front‑end **animations and motion UX** using modern libraries (e.g., *Framer Motion*), including:

  * Fade/slide animations for cards
  * Smooth metric load transitions

## Yash

* Connected the **data layer** with the rest of the project, ensuring smooth integration:

  * Airport and route datasets connect correctly to the Graph class
* Assisted in various aspects of coding, especially with components.
* Helped with **CSS implementation**, specifically focusing on:

  * Component‑level styling cohesion
  * Layout fixes
  * Visual alignment and spacing adjustments
* Contributed to creating the **project PPT**.
